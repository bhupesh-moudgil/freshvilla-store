# ✅ Admin Login & Products Fix

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Admin Login Timeout / Not Working

**Problem:** Database was reset and admin account was deleted.

**Fix:** Re-seeded database with admin account and sample products.

**Current Admin Credentials:**
```
Email: admin@freshvilla.in
Password: Admin@123
```

### 2. ✅ Products Not Loading in Admin Panel

**Problem:** No products existed in database after reset.

**Fix:** Seeded 3 sample products:
- Organic Fresh Bananas
- Fresh Red Apples
- Amul Fresh Milk

### 3. ✅ Demo Credentials Removed from Login Page

**Problem:** Login page showed hardcoded demo credentials.

**Fix:** Removed the demo credentials box from login page for security.

## 🔐 **IMPORTANT: Change Default Password**

After logging in, you should:
1. Create a new admin account with your own credentials
2. Or change the default password immediately
3. The default credentials are publicly known and insecure

---

## Test It

1. Go to https://freshvilla.in/admin/login
2. Login with:
   - Email: `admin@freshvilla.in`
   - Password: `Admin@123`
3. Go to Products page - should show 3 products
4. Products should load without timeout

---

## If Issues Persist

1. **Clear browser cache**: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
2. **Wait 30 seconds**: Render backend may need to wake up from sleep
3. **Check backend status**: https://freshvilla-backend.onrender.com/api/health

**Everything should work now!** 🎉
