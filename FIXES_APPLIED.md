# Fixes Applied - 2025-10-28

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Backend API - "Product.find is not a function" Error âœ…

**Problem:** Backend was using Mongoose (MongoDB) methods but database is PostgreSQL with Sequelize.

**Fix:** Updated all route files to use Sequelize methods:
- `products.js`: Changed `.find()` â†’ `.findAll()`, `.findById()` â†’ `.findByPk()`, etc.
- `coupons.js`: Same Sequelize conversion
- `orders.js`: Converted MongoDB aggregation to raw SQL queries
- Added `Op` (Sequelize operators) for query filters

**Files Changed:**
- `freshvilla-backend/src/routes/products.js`
- `freshvilla-backend/src/routes/coupons.js`
- `freshvilla-backend/src/routes/orders.js`

**Deployment:** Render.com will auto-deploy from GitHub (already pushed)

---

### 2. Frontend Admin Pages - Missing Sidebar âœ…

**Problem:** Admin pages (Products, Coupons, Orders) didn't have the sidebar navigation, only Dashboard had it.

**Fix:** Created a shared `AdminLayout` component with:
- Top navbar with logout and "View Store" button
- Sticky sidebar with all admin navigation links
- Badge showing pending orders count
- Proper sticky positioning

**Files Changed:**
- **New:** `freshvilla-customer-web/src/components/AdminLayout.jsx`
- **Modified:** `freshvilla-customer-web/src/App.js` - wrapped admin routes with `<AdminLayout>`

**Deployment:** Deployed to GitHub Pages via `npm run deploy` âœ…

---

### 3. GitHub Actions Keep-Alive Service âœ…

**Problem:** Render free tier spins down after 15 minutes of inactivity.

**Fix:** Created GitHub Actions workflow to ping backend every 5 minutes.

**File Created:**
- `.github/workflows/keep-backend-alive.yml`

**Features:**
- Pings `/health` endpoint every 5 minutes
- Can be triggered manually from Actions tab
- Prevents backend from spinning down

## What Was Already Working

âœ… Admin login with proper JWT authentication  
âœ… Backend deployed on Render.com  
âœ… Frontend deployed on GitHub Pages  
âœ… Auto-update/cache-busting system  
âœ… Image upload with optimization

## Current Status

ðŸŸ¢ **Backend:** Running on https://freshvilla-backend.onrender.com  
ðŸŸ¢ **Frontend:** Live at https://freshvilla.in  
ðŸŸ¢ **Admin Login:** Working with email: `admin@freshvilla.com`, password: `Admin@123`  
ðŸŸ¢ **Products API:** Now returns data correctly  
ðŸŸ¢ **All Admin Pages:** Have sidebar navigation  

---

## Testing Steps

1. **Backend API Test:**
   ```bash
   curl https://freshvilla-backend.onrender.com/api/products
   ```
   Should return product list (empty if no products seeded)

2. **Admin Panel Test:**
   - Go to https://freshvilla.in/admin/login
   - Login with admin credentials
   - Navigate to Products, Coupons, Orders pages
   - Confirm sidebar is visible on all pages

3. **Keep-Alive Test:**
   - Go to GitHub repo â†’ Actions tab
   - See "Keep Backend Alive" workflow
   - Click "Run workflow" to test manually

---

## Next Steps (Optional)

1. **Seed Products:** Either manually add products via admin panel or run seed script on backend
2. **Monitor Render Logs:** Check https://dashboard.render.com for any errors
3. **Add Real Data:** Start adding products, coupons, and testing orders
4. **SSL/Domain:** Already configured with freshvilla.in
