## 🐛 Known Issues & Technical Debt

### High Priority
1. ⚠️ Model associations not centralized (need index file)
2. ⚠️ Database migrations missing (need creation scripts)
3. ⚠️ No API tests yet (need Jest setup)

### Medium Priority
1. ⚠️ Validation middleware needs centralization (consider Joi)
2. ⚠️ Logging could be improved (consider Winston)
3. ⚠️ No API versioning strategy yet

### Low Priority
1. ⚠️ Caching layer not implemented (consider Redis)
2. ⚠️ WebSocket for real-time updates not built
3. ⚠️ Background job processing not set up

---

## 📊 Performance Considerations

### Current State
- ✅ Pagination on all list endpoints (prevents memory issues)
- ✅ Indexes on all foreign keys (fast lookups)
- ✅ Transaction safety (prevents race conditions)
- ✅ Composite indexes on common queries

### Recommendations
- Consider adding Redis caching for frequently accessed data
- Monitor query performance with query analyzers
- Implement database connection pooling if not already done
- Add CDN for static assets
