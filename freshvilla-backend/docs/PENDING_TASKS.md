## üìù Notes

### Database Structure Tasks (High Priority)
**Why Critical:**
- Foundation for scalability
- Required for proper reporting
- Enables location-based features
- Improves data integrity
- Reduces technical debt

**Impact if Not Done:**
- Cannot distinguish store types
- Poor query performance
- No location-based analytics
- Data integrity issues
- Difficult to scale

### Invoice System Tasks (Medium Priority)
**Why Important:**
- Compliance (e-way bills)
- Better insights (aging reports)
- Operational efficiency

**Impact if Not Done:**
- Manual e-way bill generation
- Limited visibility into overdue invoices
- Manual follow-ups needed

### Nice to Have Tasks (Low Priority)
**Why Optional:**
- Can work without them initially
- Can be added incrementally
- ROI lower than critical fixes

---

## üÜò Blockers & Dependencies

### No Blockers Currently
All tasks can proceed independently

### Dependencies:
- City master table should be done before linking customers/orders
- Associations file should be done after FK relationships are added
- Indexes should be last (after structure is finalized)
