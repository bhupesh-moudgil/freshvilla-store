# ✅ Final Confirmation - Product Integration & Non-Veg Removal

## Question 1: Are Homepage Products Linked to Admin?

### ✅ YES - 100% LINKED

**Homepage products are fully connected to the admin panel database.**

### How It Works:

1. **Homepage displays products from database** with `featured: true`
2. **ProductItem component** fetches from API: `productsAPI.getAll({ featured: true })`
3. **Any changes in admin panel instantly reflect on homepage**

### What You Can Do from Admin:

| Action | Result on Homepage |
|--------|-------------------|
| Add product + mark "Featured" | ✅ Appears on homepage immediately |
| Edit featured product | ✅ Changes show on next page load |
| Delete featured product | ✅ Removed from homepage instantly |
| Uncheck "Featured" | ✅ Product removed from homepage |
| Update price/discount | ✅ New price shows on homepage |
| Change image | ✅ New image displays on homepage |
| Mark "Out of Stock" | ✅ Shows as unavailable on homepage |

### Test It Yourself:

1. Login to admin: https://freshvilla.in/admin/login
2. Go to **Products** → **Add Product**
3. Create a product and check ✅ **Featured Product**
4. Save the product
5. Visit https://freshvilla.in homepage
6. **Your product will appear in the "Popular Products" section**
7. Edit the product in admin (change price, name, etc.)
8. Refresh homepage - **changes will appear**
9. Delete product from admin
10. Refresh homepage - **product will be gone**

   - ❌ Category section from featured categories
