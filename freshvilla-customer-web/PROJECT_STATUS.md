## 🚀 What Needs to Be Built for Full Functionality

### Phase 1: Backend API (Essential)
**Priority: HIGH**

1. **Node.js + Express API Server**
   - Product CRUD endpoints
   - Order management endpoints
   - Admin authentication
   - File upload (product images)

2. **Database Setup**
   - MongoDB or PostgreSQL
   - Collections/Tables:
     - Products
     - Orders
     - Customers
     - Coupons
     - Admin Users

3. **Connect Frontend to Backend**
   - Replace `products.json` with API calls
   - Use `fetch` or `axios` for HTTP requests
   - Update CartContext to use backend

### Phase 2: Admin Dashboard (High Priority)
**Priority: HIGH**

Build a complete admin panel with:
- ✅ Product Management
  - Add/Edit/Delete products
  - Upload product images (AWS S3 or Cloudinary)
  - Set prices and discounts
  - Manage stock levels
  
- ✅ Coupon Management
  - Create discount coupons
  - Set percentage/fixed amount discounts
  - Set validity dates
  - Track usage
  
- ✅ Order Management
  - View all orders
  - Update order status
  - Generate invoices

- ✅ Admin Authentication
  - Secure login system
  - Role-based access control

### Phase 3: Enhanced Features (Medium Priority)
**Priority: MEDIUM**

- Payment gateway integration (Razorpay/Stripe)
- Email notifications
- SMS notifications
- Order tracking
- Customer accounts
- Wishlist functionality
- Product reviews & ratings

## 🎯 Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate (To make admin functional):

1. **Set up Backend Server**
   ```bash
   # Create a new Node.js + Express project
   mkdir freshvilla-backend
   cd freshvilla-backend
   npm init -y
   npm install express mongoose dotenv multer cors
   ```

2. **Create Database Schema**
   - Products model
   - Coupons model
   - Orders model

3. **Build API Endpoints**
   ```
   POST   /api/products         - Add new product
   GET    /api/products         - Get all products
   PUT    /api/products/:id     - Update product
   DELETE /api/products/:id     - Delete product
   
   POST   /api/coupons          - Create coupon
   GET    /api/coupons          - Get all coupons
   POST   /api/coupons/validate - Validate coupon code
   ```

4. **Build Admin Dashboard**
   - Create admin routes
   - Product management forms
   - Coupon management interface
   - Image upload functionality

5. **Connect Frontend to Backend**
   - Replace JSON imports with API calls
   - Update ProductCard to use dynamic data
   - Implement loading states

## 💡 Quick Fix for Demo Purposes

**If you need to quickly test product changes without backend:**

1. Edit `src/data/products.json` directly
2. Add/modify/delete products in the JSON file
3. Refresh the browser

**Example:**
```json
{
  "id": 11,
  "name": "New Product",
  "price": 150,
  "originalPrice": 200,
  "discount": 25,
  "category": "Groceries",
  "image": "/images/product-img-11.jpg",
  "description": "Fresh new product",
  "rating": 4.5,
  "reviews": 10,
  "featured": true,
  "inStock": true,
  "unit": "1kg"
}
```

## 🔐 Security Notes

⚠️ **Current Security Issues:**
- No authentication on admin routes
- No API rate limiting
- Sensitive operations in client-side code
- No input sanitization

**Must be fixed before production deployment!**
